Step 1: Initialization 
1. Sensor Setup: 
Install capacitive sensors, infrared sensors, and pressure sensors 
around the cutting blade.Connect sensors to a microcontroller or edge device 
for data processing. 
2. System Configuration: 
Initialize sensor thresholds for detecting skin or unusual proximity. 
Load a pre-trained ML model onto the microcontroller. 
Step 2: Data Collection and Preprocessing 
1. Real-time Data Collection: 
Continuously collect data from the sensors during woodcutting 
operations. 
2. Data Preprocessing: 
Normalize sensor readings for consistent input to the ML model. 
Remove noise from data (e.g., irrelevant environmental readings). 
Step 3: ML Model Training (Offline) 
1. Dataset Preparation:  
Gather labeled data representing normal operations (cutting wood) 
and hazardous events (contact with human skin or unexpected objects). 
2. Model Selection: 
Choose an appropriate ML algorithm (e.g., decision tree, neural 
network, or SVM) based on the dataset complexity. 
3. Training and Validation: 
Train the model to recognize patterns distinguishing safe from unsafe 
scenarios. Validate the model using test data to ensure accuracy and 
reliability. 
4. Deployment: 
Deploy the trained model onto the edge device for real-time decision
making. 
Step 4: Real-Time Hazard Detection 
1. Data Input: 
Feed live sensor data into the ML model running on the 
microcontroller. 
2. Prediction: 
The ML model analyzes the data to predict whether the current 
operation is safe or hazardous. 
3. Threshold Monitoring: 
Compare the model's prediction to predefined safety thresholds. If the prediction indicates a hazard, proceed to the next step.
Step 5: Trigger Braking Mechanism 
1. Brake Activation: 
Send a signal to the electromagnetic braking system or spring-loaded 
brake to stop the blade instantly. 
2. Time Optimization: 
Ensure the blade stops within milliseconds to minimize injury. 
Step 6: Feedback and Adaptation 
1. Error Logging: 
Log instances of false positives (unnecessary braking) and false 
negatives (missed hazards). 
2. Model Update: 
Retrain the ML model periodically using updated data to improve 
accuracy. 
3. System Calibration: 
Adjust sensor thresholds or model sensitivity based on feedback to 
enhance performance. 
Step 7: Safety and Efficiency Monitoring 
1. Continuous Monitoring: 
Regularly assess system performance to ensure reliable hazard 
detection and braking response. 
2. User Alerts: 
Notify the operator of any system errors or necessary maintenance. 
Summary of Algorithm Workflow: 
1. Initialize sensors and deploy the trained ML model. 
2. Collect and preprocess real-time sensor data. 
3. Feed data into the ML model for hazard prediction. 
4. Trigger the braking mechanism upon hazard detection. 
5. Log feedback and periodically update the system for improved safety and efficiency
